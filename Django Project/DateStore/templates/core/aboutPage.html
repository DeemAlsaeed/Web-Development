            Founded in 2024, <strong class="name">Sukri&Kalas</strong> was born out of a love for dates and a desire to share their incredible flavors with the world.
            Our founder, <b style="color: #5b4a2f;">Deem</b>, grew up surrounded by date palms in  <b style="color: #5b4a2f;">AlQassim</b>, where dates were not just
            a fruit but a way of life. Inspired by this rich heritage, <Strong class="name">Sukri&Kalas</Strong> set out to create a platform that celebrates the diversity
            and versatility of dates.
